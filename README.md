# Sproutcore 2.0 Handlebars

Pretty much what it sounds like. The biggest goal being the capability of precompiling templates on the serverside during the build process.

Trying to come up with the best api, so feel free to fork and suggest. Alot of it is just proxied right into the handlebars module from @kpdecker (via @wycats )


## Version

1.0.2beta  -- This just stays in sync with the last tested version of sproutcore handlebars.

If I were to actually version this, it'd be like -4 or so. probably.
