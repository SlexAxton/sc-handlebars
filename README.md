# Sproutcore 2.0 Handlebars

Pretty much what it sounds like. The biggest goal being the capability of precompiling templates on the serverside during the build process.

Trying to come up with the best api, so feel free to fork and suggest. Alot of it is just proxied right into the handlebars module from @kpdecker (via @wycats )

## Docs

More or less, this is the same as the `handlebars` module in npm. It has the same interface, this is just a little wrapper around it. So most of your learning would be done here:

https://github.com/kpdecker/handlebars.js

## Version

1.0.2beta  -- This just stays in sync with the last tested version of sproutcore handlebars.

If I were to actually version this, it'd be like -4 or so. probably.
